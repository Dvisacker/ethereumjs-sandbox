# ethereum-tutorial

Ethereum is a secure decentralized platform facilitating arbitrarily complex computations. For an overview, read the [white paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper). 

This tutorial is essentially an organization of my own approach to understanding the command-line tools and the Solidity language for smart contracts. Please note this is a work in progress.


The code here contains everything referenced or used in the tutorial.
