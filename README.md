## ethereumjs sandbox

* While learning the basics of Ethereum and Solidity, I frequently wrapped tasks in scripts. After joining [Rubix](https://rubixbydeloitte.com) to work with prototyping Dapps, these became useful in our work, so I was encouraged to continue working on them.


* There are [other frameworks](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/607/how-to-unit-test-smart-contracts)
written by better developers than myself. The main reason I prefer to use this is because it was extremely easy to make, and can hence be reconstructed for explanatory purposes. I have also found it more instructive to stick with just the command-line and a text editor for now.
